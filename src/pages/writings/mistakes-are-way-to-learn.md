<!-- # Mistakes Are the Way to Learn! -->

Recently, I was doing ice skating for the first time in my life. After stepping onto the ice surface, I couldn't balance myself and suddenly fell down. The first thought that came to my mind was: *Did anyone see me falling down?* But no one was looking at me—they were busy enjoying their skating. 

I gathered courage and stood up again. I asked a girl who was passing by to teach me some basics of skating, and she gladly guided me. With a little hand-holding and support, I was able to keep my balance for a while and gradually started to skate.

I fell down 2–3 more times later, but this time, I stood up, kept my balance, and smiled at myself. I didn’t feel the fear of making mistakes while skating anymore.

When I reflected on these events after a few days, I realized that, as adults, we are often afraid of making mistakes when trying new things. We carry this fear in our minds, worrying about whether someone saw us making mistakes or if someone will make fun of us. 

But if we shift our perspective, we might see that others are likely thinking the same thing—or they might be too busy with their own activities to even notice!

So next time, whenever you're trying out a new skill or activity, don't be afraid to make mistakes. Embrace the process and keep learning.
